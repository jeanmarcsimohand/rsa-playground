RSA keygen / encryption / decryption python implementation
--------

This piece of code has been written for educational purposes.

This implementation is SLOW and UNSECURE:

**DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION**


Note to students:
-----------------

If you're a student and you want to re-use this piece of code, feel free!!
but keep in mind the following bullets:
* before re-using this in a lecture, read all links provided in comments
* ensure to well understand what this code does
* let me know if this was helpful or not


How does it work?
------

Basically, even if it's a Python script,  the main goal is not to execute it.
The idea is to see what's under the RSA hood and how RSA works.

I put a lots of comments / wikipedia links in the code to make it as clear a possible.
Please navigate through this piece of code, I hope this will help you to understand RSA mechanisms.

Test Keygen/Encryption and Decryption:
Current version of the program is **not** interactive (coming soon).
just launch the script with:
```bash
python3 rsa-playground.py
```

you can change key size, public exponent and input message in the code, feel free to play around this.
